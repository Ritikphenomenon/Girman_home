#  Girman Technologies

## Objective

A search-based web application. This app will feature a simple landing page with search functionality, fetching results from a locally stored JSON file.

## Features

1. **Home Screen:**
   - A minimalistic landing page with Girman Technologies branding.
   - A top navigation bar with the following links:
     - **Website**: Redirects to [girmantech.com](https://girmantech.com)
     - **LinkedIn**: Redirects to Girman Technologies' LinkedIn company page.
     - **Contact**: Opens the user's default email client with a prefilled email to `contact@girmantech.com`.
   - A search box where users can input search terms.

2. **Search Results Page:**
   - A search bar that returns results upon pressing "Enter."
   - Each search result is displayed in a **card-based UI** containing:
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Address
     - Phone Number
     - A placeholder image for all users.
   - Edge case handling, displaying a message when no results are found.

3. **User Data:**
   - User data is stored locally in a JSON file (`data/users.json`).
   - The app reads and filters this data based on the search query, showing matching results.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The app handles empty search results, invalid input, and error messages gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the app.
